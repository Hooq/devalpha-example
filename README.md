# DevAlpha example

A simple example of using DevAlpha to see charts and various backtesting metrics.

**Note**: DevAlpha is currently running in private beta, and so you will not be able to access the backtester until you have [signed up for the private beta](https://devalpha.io/)!

## Usage

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devalpha-io/devalpha-example.git
cd devalpha-example
```
Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the example.

```bash
npm start
```

Now, open [beta.devalpha.io](https://beta.devalpha.io) in your favorite browser, sign in, and open the backtester to see how your strategy performs.

## Development

```
npm run dev
```

This will activate a watcher on `index.js` so that you can automatically re-run your backtests when the file changes.
